			<dl class="dl-horizontal">
				<dt>Empires</dt>
				<dd>As you can see, the game board is a map of 6 European empires. They are the: British, French, Ottoman, German, Russian, and Austrian empires.</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl class="dl-horizontal">
				<dt>Territories</dt>
				<dd>Each colour-coded empire is divided into several territories marked by solid-coloured borders.</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl class="dl-horizontal">
				<dt style="font-weight: normal"><em>Example:</em></dt>
				<dd>The territories that comprise the British Empire are: Yorkshire, Ireland, Wales, London, and Scotland.</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl class="dl-horizontal">
				<dt>Independant Territories</dt>
				<dd>There are also 11 colour-coded Independent territories. These are, as their name states, completely independent and do not make up an empire. The Independent territories are: Norway, Madrid, Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal, Venice, Finland, Barcelona, Rome, Denmark, and Naples.</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl class="dl-horizontal">
				<dt>Dotted Lines</dt>
				<dd>You will notice that there are certain territories separated by water, but connected by dotted lines. The dotted lines indicate that army movement between these territories is possible without the use of the Admiral ship.</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl class="dl-horizontal">
				<dt>The Black Sea</dt>
				<dd>Note that the Black Sea is the only major body of water on the board that's completely land-locked. Therefore, when using the Admiral's ship on the Black Sea, you can only carry armies to and from territories that border directly on it. You cannot use the Admiral's ship to carry armies from a territory on the Black Sea to a territory that borders on another body of water, or vice versa.</dd>
			</dl>

		</div><h3 id="Setup">Setup</h3><hr class="underline"><div class="holder">
			<ol>
				<li>
				<p>Get a pencil and a sheet of paper.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Choose an army colour and separate out the appropriate number of starting armies, using single-army pieces: 2 players: 40 each. 3 players: 35 each. 4 players: 30 each. 5 players: 25 each. 6 players: 20 each.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Roll a die to see who will place armies first. High roller draws an empire's banner, sight unseen, inserts it into a castle, and places that castle on any territory within the empire represented by the initial on the banner. Then, he or she places 1 army piece next to the castle.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>THIS IS THE CASTLE THAT PLAYER MUST DEFEND. Starting from that player's <em>left</em>, everybody, in turn, draws an empire banner, places a castle and 1 army in the same manner.
				<br /><em>HINT</em>: Its best to place your castle next to the sea.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Starting with the same first player, everybody, in turn, places a single-army piece on any unoccupied territory in any empire. Continue taking turns until each territory is occupied by a single army.
				<br /><em>HINT</em>: Occupy an entire empire if you can.</p>
				<p>Now, each player, in turn, places 5 armies at the same time, divided up in anyway, on any territories that he or she already occupies. Do so until all starting armies have been placed.</p>
				<em>HINT</em>: Strongly fortify your castle with armies.
				<ul>
					<li>There is no limit to the number of armies you can place on any one territory.</li>
					<li><p>At any time, substitute 10 single-army pieces for one 10-army piece on a territory or vice versa.</p></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>In secret, choose a territory where you will place your "Hidden Armies" (see <a href="#HiddenArmies">Hidden Armies</a>). It may be any territory except one occupied by a castle. Write down the name on a piece of paper and slip it under the game board.</p>
				</li>
				<li> 
				<p>Shuffle the cards and deal 3 <em>face down</em> to each player (who looks at them in secret). Place the remaining cards facedown to form a draw pile. Again, roll the die to see who starts playing first. Play passes to the <em>left</em>.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

				<dl>
					<dt>BATTLE and ATTACK</dt>
					<dd>Refer to the following definitions of the words, BATTLE and ATTACK to be sure players have a clear understanding of their meanings in this game:<ul>
						<li>BATTLE: is a single "fight" between two enemy armies (one roll of the dice).</li>
						<li>ATTACK: is made up of one or more battles.</li>

		</div><h3 id="StrategyHints">Strategy Hints</h3><hr class="underline"><div class="holder">
			<p>Strategies vary from game to game. Here are some basic strategies which hold true for all or most games:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fortify your castle well! Remember-if you lose it, you're out of the game.</li>
				<li>Placing your castle on a territory next to the sea allows you to use the armies that occupy it for naval invasions. (Chances are this territory has a large number of armies to work with. Remember: You can replace them at the end of your turn with spoils.)</li>
				<li>To defeat a castle, odds are you need to attack with double the number of armies that are defending it, because you can only use 2 dice.</li>
				<li>When attacking with your Admiral card, attack a weakly defended territory first. Then attack your main objective from there-by land. By doing so, you'll have a better chance of keeping your Admiral card&mdash;rather than losing it in a tougher battle from the sea.</li>
				<li>When attacking another player's territory, consider stopping the attack when the player is down to 1 army&mdash;especially if that player's territory acts as a buffer between you and another threatening territory. Remember, the player cannot attack with 1 army, and cannot move armies through territories he or she occupies.</li>

			<p>Verbal negotiations are allowed, but are not enforceable. Negotiations must be conducted openly, never in secret. The terms of the negotiations may be carried out at any time.</p>
